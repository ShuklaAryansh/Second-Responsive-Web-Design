# Second-Responsive-Web-Design
Check out my second responsive web design project! Building on concepts from my first project, Iâ€™ve integrated new techniques and creative designs. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a visually stunning site that enhances user experience. I prioritized accessibility and usability to ensure everyone can enjoy it. Thank you!
